# How to Speak, Patrick Winston (2018)

- Start with a promise - what you'll learn from the talk
- Cycle through/back to ideas - everyone isn't going to catch something the first time you say it
- Build a fence around your idea - what makes your idea different from similar ideas
- Verbal punctuation - take a pause to explain transitions in subject so people can "get back on the bus"
- Asking questions - can wait for 7 seconds for an answer
- Keep the lights up - keeps people awake
- Chalk for teaching - graphic quality, forces slower pacing, gives your hands something to do
- Empathetic mirroring - watching someone write on a board makes something feel more real than slides
- Slides for exposing - no title, not too many words, don't read from slides, should be condiments for your talk, remove clutter (including bullets)
- No laser pointers - requires you to break eye contact - just put arrows on your slides
- Props for new ways to visualize a problem
- People are inspired by speakers who show passion for subject
- Situate - explain the world in which your subject exists ("nobody has made progress on this topic in 3 decades", etc.)
- Job Talks - express your vision, show that you've done something (show your steps), all within 5 minutes, then enumerate your contributions
- Vision - should surround a problem someone cares about, and a unique approach
- Why be famous - your ideas are your children, concern yourself with their packaging
- Have a symbol, slogan, surprise, salient idea, and a story associated with your work
- End with your contributions
- Last words - a joke, a salute ("it's been great being here, great to see the work you've all done, good questions"), but not 'Thank You'
