- Rule governed training is not effective for high value writing
- Writing needs to be valuable to your readers - outside of school, readers are not paid to read your work
- Value is more important than newness or originality
- "Explaining" just demonstrates you understand a subject - this is not something academic readers care about
- Writing is not about communicating your ideas - it's about changing your readers' ideas
- Knowledge doesn't accumulate over time - it changes, new ideas supercede and replace old ones rather than adding to them
- Every community has their own code to communicate value - you need to know the words to use to create value
- Politely saying an existing idea is wrong is a way of communicating value - must be followed by an argument
- "I have something to add" is not interesting to your readers
- Tension/challenge/instability is interesting - words like "anomaly", "inconsistency", "but", "however", and "although" show a challenge
- Function of writing is to help a particular set of readers understand better something they want to understand well
- Move the conversation forward - don't worry about preserving knowledge indefinitely
- Knowledge is to you as corn is to a farmer - only valuable if you can market it
- Don't open with background/definitions/generalizations, as these show stability - open with the problem you're going to solve
- Identify cost/benefit patterns - do journals in your subject argue that there is a cost or a benefit to solving the inconsistencies they point out?
- Don't say you've found a gap in knowledge that your paper will fill in - knowledge isn't bounded, so finding a gap isn't interesting
- Identify the community or communities you are writing to, as well as the mistakes they are making that you intend to address
